= Introduction =

When I started to develope code using JMS, it was a new technology for me. I started with the first Hello World of ACTIVEMQ-CPP and I thought that it was an very upper level API, that gives you a easy way to distribute your content. And it's true.
<p>
If you are thinking in only one producer and one consumer that sends/receive messages probably you are thinking that you dont need to use this wrapper, and its probably true. But there are some goals that this wrapper do for you. 

= Goals =

The main goals are:

  * *Easy way to create complex JMS producer/consumer networks:* ActiveInterface provides you a simple API to distribute your JMS networks over three concepts:
        ** *Connection:* This connection wrappers a real producer/consumer. 
        ** *Link:* Link is a middle layer that allows the user to define the default properties that are sent in all messages that are producer throw this link. 
        ** *Service:* Service is the upper side and the way to send data in ActiveInterface. 

     ActiveInterface allows you to send the same message, through a service identifier, to different locations. Also ActiveInterface allows you to define the default properties that are sent with this message (through link identifier). 
     For example, if you need to send a message to a group of persons, and this message should have different properties for each person, ActiveInterface gives you a way to do it so easy, using his API (link to api) or a XML configuration file.
