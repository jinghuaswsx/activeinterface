= Introduction =

When I started to develope code using JMS, it was a new technology for me. I started with the first Hello World of ACTIVEMQ-CPP and I thought that it was an very upper level API, that gives you a easy way to distribute your content. And it's true.
<p>
If you are thinking in only one producer and one consumer that sends/receive messages probably you are thinking that you dont need to use this wrapper, and its probably true. But there are some goals that this wrapper do for you. 

= Goals =

The main goals are:

  * Easy way to create complex JMS producer/consumer networks: ActiveInterface provides you a simple API to distribute your JMS networks over three concepts:
        ** Connection: This connection wrappers a real producer/consumer. 
        ** Link: Link is a middle layer that allows the user to define the default properties that are sent in all messages that are producer throw this link. 
        ** Service: Service is the upper side and the way to send data in ActiveInterface.
